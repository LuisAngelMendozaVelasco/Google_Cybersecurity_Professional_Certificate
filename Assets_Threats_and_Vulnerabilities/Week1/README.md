# Introduction to asset security

You will be introduced to how organizations determine what assets to protect. You'll learn about the connection between managing risk and classifying assets by exploring the unique challenge of securing physical and digital assets. You'll also be introduced to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

## Learning Objectives

- Define threat, vulnerability, asset, and risk.
- Explain securityâ€™s role in mitigating organizational risk.
- Classify assets based on value.
- Identify whether data is in use, in transit, or at rest.
- Discuss the uses and benefits of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
