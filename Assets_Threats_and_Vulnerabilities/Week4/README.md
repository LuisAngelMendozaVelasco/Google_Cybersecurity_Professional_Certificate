# Threats to asset security

You will explore common types of threats to digital asset security. You'll also examine the tools and techniques used by cybercriminals to target assets. In addition, you'll be introduced to the threat modeling process and learn ways security professionals stay ahead of security breaches.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify forms of social engineering.
- Identify different types of malware.
- Identify forms of web-based exploits.
- Summarize the threat modeling process.
