Cybersecurity tools and programming languages

Youâ€™ll discover common tools used by cybersecurity analysts to identify and mitigate risk. You'll learn about security information and event management (SIEM) tools, network protocol analyzers, and programming languages such as Python and SQL.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify common tools used by entry-level security analysts
- Identify the purposes of commonly used tools
- Identify commonly used programming languages and how entry-level security analysts interact with those languages
- Discuss how entry-level security analysts use tools and programming languages to mitigate risk
