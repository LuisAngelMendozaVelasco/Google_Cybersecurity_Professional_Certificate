# Security frameworks and controls

You will focus on security frameworks and controls, along with the core components of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. You'll learn about Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) security principles and security audits.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the CIA triad.
- Explain the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks.
- Identify security principles.
- Examine how businesses use security frameworks and controls to protect business operations.
- Define security audits.
- Explore common elements of internal security audits.
