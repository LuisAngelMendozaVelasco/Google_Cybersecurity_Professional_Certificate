# Python in practice

You will put Python into practice and focus on automating cybersecurity-related tasks, which requires working with files. You'll be introduced to opening and reading files. Then, you'll learn to parse files and structure their contents. Finally, you'll focus on strategies for debugging code.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Python to automate tasks performed by security professionals.
- Use Python to open and read the contents of a file.
- Use Python to parse a file.
- Practice debugging code.
