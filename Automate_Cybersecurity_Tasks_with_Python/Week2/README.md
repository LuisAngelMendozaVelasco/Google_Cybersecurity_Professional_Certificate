# Write effective Python code

You will expand your ability to work with Python. You'll learn about pre-built and user-defined Python functions. You'll also explore how modules help provide access to reusable code. Finally, you'll make your code readable.

## Learning Objectives

- Incorporate pre-built functions into code.
- Create new, user-defined Python functions.
- Explain how modules are used in Python.
- Identify best practices to improve code readability.
