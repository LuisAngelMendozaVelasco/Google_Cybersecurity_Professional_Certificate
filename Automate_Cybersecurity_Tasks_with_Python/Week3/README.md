# Work with strings and lists

You will learn more options for working with strings and lists in Python, and discover methods that can be applied to these data types. You'll apply this knowledge to write a short algorithm. Finally, you'll use regular expressions to search for patterns in strings.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Python to work with strings and lists.
- Write a simple algorithm.
- Use regular expressions to extract information from text.
