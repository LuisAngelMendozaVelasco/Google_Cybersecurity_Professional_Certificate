# Linux commands in the Bash shell

You will be introduced to Linux commands as entered through the Bash shell. You'll use the Bash shell to navigate and manage the file system and to authorize and authenticate users. You'll also learn where to go for help when working with new Linux commands.

## Learning Objectives

- Navigate the file system using Linux commands via the Bash shell.
- Manage the file system using Linux commands via the Bash shell.
- Describe how Linux handles file permissions.
- Use Linux commands via the Bash shell to authenticate and authorize users.
- Use sudo to provide root user permissions.
- Access resources that provide support on using Linux commands.
