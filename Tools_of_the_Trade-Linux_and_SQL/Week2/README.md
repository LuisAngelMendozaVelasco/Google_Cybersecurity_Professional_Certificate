# The Linux operating system

You will be introduced to the Linux operating system and learn how it is commonly used in cybersecurity. You’ll also learn about Linux architecture and common Linux distributions. In addition, you'll be introduced to the Linux shell and learn how it allows you to communicate with the operating system.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss why Linux is commonly used in the security profession.
- Describe the architecture of the Linux operating system.
- Identify the unique features of common Linux distributions.
- Describe how a shell provides an interface for the user to interact with the operating system.
