# Network traffic and logs using IDS and SIEM tools

You will explore logs and their role in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information Event Management (SIEM) systems. You'll learn how these systems detect attacks. You’ll also be introduced to some IDS and SIEM products. In addition, you’ll write basic IDS rules to provide alerts for malicious network traffic.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss the importance of logs during incident investigation.
- Determine how to read and analyze logs during incident investigation.
- Describe how common intrusion detection system (IDS) tools provide security value.
- Interpret the basic syntax and components of signatures and logs in IDS and NIDS tools.
- Describe how SIEM tools collect, normalize, and analyze log data.
- Perform queries in SIEM tools to investigate an incident.
