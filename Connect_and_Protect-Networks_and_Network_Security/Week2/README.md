# Network operations

You will explore network protocols and how network communication can introduce vulnerabilities. In addition, you'll learn about common security measures, like firewalls, that help network operations remain safe and reliable.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize network protocols
- Describe the protocol(s) used to transmit and access data over wireless networks
- Describe a firewall
- Identify common network security measures and protocols
