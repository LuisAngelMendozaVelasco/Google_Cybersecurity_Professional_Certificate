# Security hardening

You will become familiar with network hardening practices that strengthen network systems. You'll learn how security hardening helps defend against malicious actors and intrusion methods. You'll also learn how to use security hardening to address the unique security challenges posed by cloud infrastructures.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe OS hardening techniques
- Describe network and cloud hardening techniques that target network vulnerabilities
