# Secure against network intrusions

You will understand types of network attacks and techniques used to secure compromised network systems and devices. You'll explore the many ways that malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and how cybersecurity professionals identify and close potential loopholes.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe network intrusion tactics
- Explain how to secure a network against intrusion tactics
