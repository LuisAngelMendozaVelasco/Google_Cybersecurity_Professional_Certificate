# Network architecture

You'll be introduced to network security and explain how it relates to ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. You will learn about network architecture and mechanisms to secure a network.

## Learning Objectives

- Define types of networks
- Describe physical components of a network
- Understand how the TCP/IP model provides a framework for network communication
- Explain how data is sent and received over a network
- Explain network architecture
